**Selenium Automation Sample Project**

This repository contains a Selenium automation project I created by following a course on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/QQliGCtqD2w?si=-R4TuGB6zRvNNka7) by freeCodeCamp. The course demonstrates how to use Selenium using Page Object Model to automate web-based tasks, and this repository reflects what I built while following along with the instructor.
